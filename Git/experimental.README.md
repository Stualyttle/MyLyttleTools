# Install the package:

___

## MacOS/Linux:
## `curl -sSL https://install-git.lyttle.it/experimental.sh | bash && npm --prefix ./.lyttle_tools start`

___

## Windows: 
## `curl -sSL https://install-git.lyttle.it/experimental.bat | cmd.exe && npm --prefix ./.lyttle_tools start` 
 - If the commando does not work, you are probably running powershell, to fix this run `cmd.exe` in the terminal you are currently running, and rerun the command again after running the cmd.exe command:
   - 1: `cmd.exe`
   - 2: `curl -sSL https://install-git.lyttle.it/experimental.bat | cmd.exe && cd .lyttle_tools && npm -s start`
 - If after that all it still fails
   - Open https://install-git.lyttle.it/bat
   - Press `ctrl + s` to save file, and save it as `install.bat
   - Open the file to run it. (in your github root folder)
